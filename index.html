                <p>
                    I'm a proven cross-functional team leader with over 13 years of experience in managing professionals on a global scale, helping members develop their skills and deliver above and beyond expectations. I foster collective resolutions to issues and create processes and architecture that produce scalable results. My skill set includes proficiencies across the many disciplines of quality assurance, project management, production, and people management. As an expert in Quality Assurance, my specialization is generalized, with strengths focused on managing remote and onsite teams, be it internal or external, software analysis, software testing, and software engineering. My leadership style contains a blend of strategic, democratic, laissez-faire, and visionary styles, and I value coaching, training and mentoring as keys to succes.
                    <br><br>In addition to QA and the leadership within it, I have become proficient in mobile development through the Project Management and Producer disciplines, expanding my knowledge in the industry outside of simply securing quality. As a Project Manager I have successfully transitioned large outsourcing teams to cut costs, while managing heavy localization pipelines for internationally acclaimed IP's, and as a Producer I've managed internal art pipelines and engineering workloads for my teams. Video games are my passion.
